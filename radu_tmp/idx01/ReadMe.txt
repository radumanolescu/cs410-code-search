      "text": "transformation between compressible and incompressible boundary layer equations . it is proposed to show that the boundary-layer equation of compressible flow can be reduced to that of incompressible flow .  such work was initiated by stewartson and by rott and crabtree .  in the following some of the restrictions imposed by references 1 and 2 will be removed, and it will be shown that the transformation from compressible boundary layer to incompressible boundary layer can be applied to the laminar, as well as turbulent, case .  a direct method will be used for this purpose ."

      "text": "correlated incompressible and compressible boundary layers . the boundary-layer equations for a compressible fluid are transformed into those for an incompressible fluid, assuming that the boundary is thermally insulating, that the viscosity is proportional to the absolute temperature, and that the prandtl number is unity .  various results in the theory of incompressible boundary layers are then taken over into the compressible theory .  in particular, the existence of method for retarded flows is applied to determine the point of separation for a uniformly retarded main stream velocity .  a comparison with an exact solution is used to show that this method gives a closer approximation than does pohlhausen's ."

      "text": "on the steady motion of viscous, incompressible fluids, with particular reference to a variation principle . except in exceptional cases, it is not possible to represent the motion of a viscous incompressible liquid by means of a variation principle, but all cases of such motion that have yet been discovered belong to this class of /exceptional cases ./  the appropriate functions are given ."

      "text": "vorticity interaction at an axisymmetric stagnation point in a viscous incompressible fluid . the purpose of the present note is to give an exact solution of the incompressible navier-stokes equations at an axisymmetric stagnation point with vorticity in the oncoming flow which varies linearly with distance from the axis .  this solution has application to the hypersonic axisymmetric blunt body problem, for which lighthill has shown the vorticity in the inviscid shock layer is very nearly of this form ."
